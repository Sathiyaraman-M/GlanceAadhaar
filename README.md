## ðŸ“Œ Introduction

Welcome to Glance Aadhaar, a .NET library to be designed for interacting with Aadhaar API version 2.5. This library aims to simplify communication with the Aadhaar API for .NET developers. It targets Aadhaar API specification version 2.5.

This project originated from my efforts during an internal hackathon which is rewritten from scratch to make it more solid and complete. This project is still in its very early stages, so please feel free to contribute.
